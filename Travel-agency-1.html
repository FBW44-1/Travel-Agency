            <h2 class="destination">San Francisco</h2>
            <div class="description">San Francisco may only stretch across 7 miles, but it's packed with an assortment
                of
                activities that's sure to please outdoorsy types, foodies and curious wanderers of all ages. The Golden
                Gate
                Bridge is a must-see, while a visit to Alcatraz Island to tour the infamous and now closed federal
                prison
                should also be high on your list. Instead of spending all your time around the touristy Fisherman's
                Wharf,
                you can discover a more authentic side of San Francisco by grabbing a bite at the Ferry Building
                Marketplace
                or with a walking tour through the vibrant Castro.

                <h2 class="destination">Costa Rica</h2>
                <div class="description">With so many North Americans flying south for the winter – not to mention
                    locals
                    travelling home – it’s pivotal to book in advance if you want to visit Costa Rica during high
                    season.
                    Christmas and New Year period are especially busy.

                    Hotel rooms and buses can sell out weeks ahead, but by being savvy and using several transport links
                    (such as a private shuttle), it’s possible to make things work. Alternatively, you can hire a car
                    fro
                    greater flexibility.

                        whenever I write Alaska stories, answer your comments and emails, and help you plan your trips.
                        Alaska is truly unique on our big beautiful planet; it’s The Last Frontier, one of the last
                        places
                        you can find Wild, wide-open spaces and the wildlife that live there. I want you to experience
                        it
                        to, but I know people have tons of questions about traveling to Alaska, planning a first trip,
                        and
                        lots of other topics too.
