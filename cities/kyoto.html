<h1 class="centered-big">Historic Kyoto</h1>
<img src="../kyoto.jpg" alt="Historic Kyoto" class="cities">
<p>One of Japan's most visited cities, lovely Kyoto - one of the few cities in the country to be spared the devastation of WWII - attracts more than 10 million visitors annually to explore its fine old streets and architecture, much of it unchanged since the Imperial family took up residence here more than 1,000 years ago. Even then, the city was Japan's most important cultural center, a legacy that continues with its many museums and art galleries, each bursting with important sculptures, paintings, and other art forms. Highlights of Kyoto's Buddhist-influenced architecture include its many well-preserved temples, 30 of which are still in use, and important structures such as the 14th-century Golden Pavilion (Kinkaku-ji), famous for its exquisite gold-leaf-clad exterior. Be sure to also visit Nijo Castle, a 17th-century fortress that has retained its original walls, towers, and moat; its beautiful gates; and its palace with fine interior d√©cor. Also worth a visit is the original Kyoto Imperial Palace (Kyoto-gosho), built in AD 794 and one of the city's most visited historic sites. Finally, no visit to Kyoto is complete without spending time exploring the Arashiyama Bamboo Grove, a beautiful area of tall bamboo just a few minutes' walk from the town center.</p>
