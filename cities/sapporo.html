<h1 class="centered-big">Sapporo, Hokkaido</h1>
<img src="../japan-attractions-sapporo-hokkaido.jpg" alt="Sapporo, Hokkaido" class="cities">
<p>Located on Japan's northernmost island, Hokkaido, the city of Sapporo offers many things to see and do for tourists. As the island's largest city, it's a hub of cultural activity, hosting many excellent events and festivals; a distinctive culinary style; a rich theatrical history; and plenty of museums, galleries, and parks. The focal point here is very much the city's attractive downtown area, the center of which is Odori Park, a large swath of green that's very pleasant to explore. From here, you can also access points of interest such as the Sapporo TV Tower, as well as the city's famous aerial tramway, an easy walk away. The Mount Moiwa Ropeway will eventually get you to the summit's Upper Station, from where you can enjoy incredible views over the city, a real treat at night. The mountain is also the location of the Mount Moiwa Ski Resort, a popular winter destination, especially since the 1972 Winter Olympics were held in the city. And if you're arriving in winter, be sure to visit the Sapporo Snow Festival, held here each February and drawing in excess of two million revelers.</p>
