<h1 class="centered-big">Imperial Tokyo</h1>
<img src="../imperial.jpg" alt="Imperial Tokyo" class="cities">
<p>Tokyo's most famous landmark, the Imperial Palace with its beautiful 17th-century parks surrounded by walls and moats, is a must-see when visiting the nation's capital. Don't be put off by the fact that the majority of the palace is closed to the public (it's still in use by the Imperial family), as there is still enough to see simply by strolling the grounds. In addition to the many fine views of the palace from numerous points in the surrounding parkland - including the famous Nijubashi Bridge, or "double bridge," so named for its watery reflection - visitors are permitted into the East Higashi-Gyoen Garden and other areas that are opened to the public as part of an organized tour. Another must-see for tourists visiting Tokyo is the famous Ginza shopping district, home to the Kabuki-za Theatre with its Kabuki performances, as well as the Shimbashi Enbujo Theatre with its traditional Azuma-odori dances and Bunraku performances.</p>
